  September 2, 2014 - I picked up Time magazine and one of the features was on a video game that was about to be released. The game was being advertised as a game like no other…..For one of my first web development projects, a tribute page to the people I spend most Saturday Nights with - pending Raid Boss approval for all parties involved. The aptely named Saturday Night Raid Group. The gameplay is second to none but that is not the best thing about Destiny - the best thing about Destiny is fighting space aliens with 5 of your closest friends. I'm hoping this page will explain why we play. 

So eyes up guardian here is a brief timeline of our game history…..
