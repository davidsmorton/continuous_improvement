The game was being advertised as a game like no otherâ€¦..it was call Destiny</p> <br/>
   <p class="intro"> The best thing about Destiny is dressing up your space zombie and fighting  aliens with 5 of your closest friends! For one of my first web development projects, a tribute page to the people and game I spend most Saturday Nights with - pending <strong>Raid Boss</strong> approval for all parties of course. </p> <br/>
