      <p class="intro"><strong>September 2, 2014</strong> - I picked up <a href="https://time.com/3256172/destiny-launch-guide/" target="_blank" class="time-link">Time</a> magazine (click "Time for the article") and one of the features was on a video game that was about to be released. The game was being advertised as a game like no otherâ€¦..it was called Destiny.

      <br/>
      <p class="intro"> The best thing about Destiny is dressing up your space zombie and fighting aliens with 5 of your closest friends! For one of my first web development projects, a tribute page, to the people and game I spend most Saturday Nights with - pending <strong>Raid Boss</strong> approval for all parties of course.

      <p class="intro">So eyes up guardian here is an introduction to our fire team....

      <h2 class="team-title">The Team</h2>
       <ul> 
        <li><strong>JC</strong> - A Warlock turned Hunter but now can't see himself going back. He's a grizzled veteran of Destiny (D1) and Destiny 2 (D2).  
        <p>Playstyle: Agressive with calculated risks.
        </p>
        <q class="quote">Hey ya'll, this is my last run...(we all know it's not JC)</q>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Dan</strong> - A Titan - "the tip of the spear". He's a skilled veteran of D1 and D2. He's a gear snob - gotta have 15 / 15 or shard it.  
        <p>Playstyle: Aggressive - He's a master with a pulse rifle in his hands...invaders in Gambit watch out...
        </p>
        <q class="quote">Give me a sec, I need to do a little inventory managment!</q>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Anime</strong> - A pure Hunter - regardless of the weapon aliens and guardians alike are in trouble when Anime shows up. A vetren of D1 and D2 he's the most efficent player on the team when it comes to completing Quests but he's still missing one important emote. A D1 champ check out his trophies.   
        <p>Playstyle: Agressive </p>
        <q class="quote">Guys, I gotta go to the Tower to pick up my package!</q>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Zimbu</strong>  - A sharpshooting Hunter that prides himself on quick head shots...no spray and pray for this guy. Zim is up for any challenge and is always checking corners.

        <q class="quote">A Warlock jumped in front of my rocket. Sigh.</q>
        </li>
        <br/> 
        <li><strong>Tac</strong> - Another Hunter and this guy is a master sword wielder - if you need a sword Tac is there. A recent addition to the team he's only been playing Destiny for a week.</p>
        <p>Playstyle: Unknown</p>
        <q class="quote">I'm down, does anyone have a revive?</q>
