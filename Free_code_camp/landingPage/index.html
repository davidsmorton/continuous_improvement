  <h1> About Me</h1>

  <p> Hi! My name is Scott Morton P.Geol (AB), P.Geo (BC), MBA (2019), BSc. Geology (2000), Hydrogeology Diploma NAIT (2004), Web Development Diploma Lighthouse Labs (2020). I've been a practicing Hydrogeologist for over 20yrs (rounded up) - a fucking long time to be looking down small dark holes! So I've decided to switch it up. I am now a dog Psychologist / Psychotherapist - This combines the best of my "Bitch"  and "Stud" (it's a dog term, I looked it up, sorry Mom). 
  </div>
  <p>My Mom was a successful psychologist (retired) and my Dad has a great way with animals! So basically I have both of their talents in me and I'll be exploiting those underdeveloped talents for money. I'll be avoiding all genetic questions or reasonable arguments about why this or any other statement on the site is or isn't true. So don't bother - but the result of them, uhh you know, was me and my older brother. It's science.</p> 
  <p> My brother is able to communicate with cats - I've known this for years and have seen it - he can really talk to them. I've been fighting this my whole life but I'm ready to share my talent with the world - I can talk to dogs. Yep - every time fido barks <strong>I know exactly what he's saying.</strong></p>
